# Code to reproduce results in "Vaccines alone cannot slow the evolution of SARS-CoV-2"

Simulation and plotting code for Figs. 1-4 (population-level simulations) is found in variant_emergence_poplevel_sims.ipynb.

Simulation and plotting code for Figs. 5-6 (within-host simulations) is found in variant_emergence_intrahost.ipynb.

Note that some of these stochastic simulations (particularly the intrahost ones) can take a while to run.
